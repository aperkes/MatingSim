In progress mating sim. Needs plenty of work.. 

Works best in Jupyter, open Mating.ipynb

implementation is basically
history = run_trial()

or for a full simulation
record = run_simulation()

history is an object with various arrays. 
record is a list of dicts, containing stats defined in SimStats.py

You'll need the python module networkX for this to run.
