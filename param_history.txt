1/22/16: Tried just doing negative with classical female strategy. No Monogamy
1/22/16: Tried boosting the shift scaler to .3, still seems like it's not hitting equilibrium. 
1/22/16: Tried running for 3000, still not hitting equilibrium, noticed that males aren't changing at all in 3000 turns. That's probably wrong. Something is weird with the reward matrix...
-not exactly weird, it's that the females are so crowded no one is reproducing, so there's no reward that any of the males can see, so they can't respond to the rewards. Turns out there was a bug in adjacency update function
1/22/19: Males focus on a signle female, but many end up on the same female. females are only getting negative benefits...it actually seems like there is a bias towards sharing females. As before, it seems like females are not reaching equilibrium, although males reach it rapidly. 
1/22/19: Fixed some bugs and now it seems like the program runs as expected, but same basic behavior of males focussing on a couple females. There's a broader problem in that males have no way to ease off (which would benefit both them and the female) But the females should be responding more strategically.
1/22/19: INTERESTING: If females have enough resources that they can outrun all males, monogamy starts to shake out better. Now females also need a way to ease off investment to commit more into foraging, but this seems to indicate that if females can't evade males, there's no punishment/reward they can offer. That said, we're still not seeing monogamy, and there still seems to be some bias for already busy females. But I think my strategy is wrong here. Males need an optimization strategy that doesn't require them to invest all their resources. Females could probably have a similar strategy.
1/22/19: Assuming the code works, I set up a little optimization function. I'll need to check to make sure it's running properly, but it seems to not collectively coverge on the best solution. I think females need to take a more active hand (rather than exploring, deliberately invest certain males or something. Oh! maybe they just need to invest less (remember, investment is fleeing)
-Nope, that's not it, the optimization method deals with that. 
-The problem also does not go away by removing randomization (in fact that ruins it, since they never start moving) 
-It seems to be that the change in reward is much more influenced by what everyone else does than by what they individually do. This too could probably be resolved by looking at change in adjacency (which is individually determined)
1/22/19 - Setting it to adjacency doesn't fix it. It seems like it's just too big of a space for a naive optimization to not get stuck in local optima..
- It still seems like it might work if females take an active hand.
1/28/19 - I tried it with just two birds. Here we do get monogamy shaking out some of the time. It's clear there is some problem. It seems like both males and females should be able to ease off, but they don't. 
1/28/19 - Things actually get better when females do nothing. With no fleeing it allows males to hash it out amongst themselves and get to decent equilibria. It's not great though. 
1/28/19 - It's really a problem of perverse incentives: Everyone would be best served by each male courting a single female, minimally. However, in such a scenario, males can increase their success by investing more than the other male. But what if females just blocked one male completely? Or rewarded the lowest investing male? Lets start with them just picking their number.
1/28/19 - This sort of works. But there are challenges: males when they get 0 reward always, don't have a good way to optimize to 0. I guess their reward needs some nominal value for their investment? 
1/28/19 - I added a factor to subtract investment (*.1) from the reward, which should incentivize decreasing investment where they're getting no reward...there's a minor bug that females get benefits from investment even when they run away constantly. Also, it doesn't count the cost of running away, which is a bit silly. But what's the bigger problem? ? ?
